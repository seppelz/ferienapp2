git commit -m "fix: Calendar now properly updates when year changes

Previously when clicking 2025/2026 buttons:
- Holiday markers would update âœ“
- Calendar dates would NOT update âœ—

Now:
- Added useEffect to watch for year prop changes
- Calendar properly re-renders with correct year dates
- Both holidays AND calendar dates update together

The calendar now shows January 2025 when clicking 2025,
and January 2026 when clicking 2026."
