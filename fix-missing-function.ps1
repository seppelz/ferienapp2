git commit -m "fix: Add missing isDateDisabled function causing 2026 dates to be unclickable

CRITICAL BUG FIX:
- DesktopCalendar.tsx was calling isDateDisabled() function that didn't exist
- This was causing TypeScript errors and preventing date selection
- Added isDateDisabled() function that checks if date is before today
- Added isDateInRange() function for range selection highlighting
- Fixed hardcoded 2025-01-01 reference in MainLayout to use dynamic year

ROOT CAUSE:
- Missing function definitions in DesktopCalendar component
- Calendar was calling undefined functions
- Hardcoded date reference prevented proper year switching

FIX:
1. Added isDateDisabled(date) function - returns true if date before today
2. Added isDateInRange(date) function - checks if date within selected range
3. Changed MainLayout focus selector from '2025-01-01' to use selectedYear variable

NOW WORKING:
âœ… Date selection in vacation picker for 2026
âœ… Proper date validation (no past dates)
âœ… Range selection highlighting
âœ… Year-aware date focus"
