git commit -m "fix: Remove hardcoded 2025 year restriction in date validation

CRITICAL BUG FOUND:
Line 435 in DesktopCalendar.tsx had:
  if (date.getFullYear() !== 2025) return true;

This was blocking ALL dates that weren't in 2025!

FIX:
Changed to:
  if (isBefore(date, today)) return true;

Now allows any future dates, regardless of year.

Also removed duplicate function definitions that were causing build errors."
